### ✅ Shipped & Verified Architectural Deliverables (14 Core Epics)

#### 🏛️ 1. Spatial Micro-Kernel & OS Router
- [x] **SpatialTopology Engine**: Implemented multi-floor coordinate indexing `(x, y, z)` supporting Floors `-1, 0, 1` with continuous spring physics.
- [x] **Pluggable SpatialModule Contract**: Vertical-slice architecture allowing each room to define its Floor 0 and Floor 1 views independently.
- [x] **Spatial Physics & Motion**: Configured Runge-Kutta springs (`SpatialPhysics`), critical damping, and overscroll rubber-banding.

#### 🧠 2. Zero-UI Hybrid Voice Intent Bus
- [x] **Two-Tier Dispatcher**: Sub-5ms fast-path regex execution for sovereign offline commands + Multimodal fallback via Gemini 2.0 Flash.
- [x] **Core Audio Synthesis**: Dynamic sound cue tokens (`SoundCue`) with spatial frequency shifts when ascending to Floor 1.
- [x] **Tactile Haptic Feedback**: Context-aware haptics manager with pulse ticking for microphone listening and triple-tap SOS alerts.

#### 🗄️ 3. Encrypted Local Vault & Cloud Sync (Offline-First)
- [x] **Drift SQLite Architecture**: 10 relational encrypted tables managing tasks, alarms, contacts, messages, SOS alerts, and vision scans.
- [x] **Schema Migration v6**: Persistent user persona state (`blind_accessible` vs `digital_minimalist`) and onboarding completion flags.
- [x] **Supabase Sync Engine**: Non-blocking bidirectional synchronization with soft-delete reconciliation and network resilience.

#### 👁️ 4. Inclusive Design & Dual Interaction Paradigms
- [x] **WCAG 2.2 AAA Theme**: Pure OLED pitch-black palette with 21:1 high-contrast cyan/yellow tokens for visual impairments.
- [x] **Editorial Warm Paper Theme**: Calming serif typography and muted earthy tones for digital minimalists.
- [x] **Interactive Onboarding Gateways**: 4-step voice-guided accessibility flow + 4-step intentional productivity flow.
- [x] **5 Core Spatial Rooms**: Complete implementation of Cockpit, Focus/Timer, Comms/Radar, Vision Studio, and Agenda across Floors 0 and 1.
- [x] **Hardware Abstraction Layer**: Native Android MethodChannel integration for system flashlight, background alarms, and app launch.
